# Content Management System

## Description

This project was done to demonstrate the knowledge base I have gained in SQL and express. It utilize both concepts to a very wide extent to track employees, with IDs, salaries based on department and also manager ID numbers. It allows an organization to keep track of who is who practically. I utilized node as well in this which i have used in previous projects and it gets easier and easier.

## Installation

To run this you will need to utilize an IDE with a terminal. I personally use VsCode it works perfectly for many things. Second you will need to use "mpn i" to install all dependancies on your local machine to be able to use this application and not error it out. Then after that to run it you can use node index which is running node.js and the main javascript file i have.
